## Hi, I'm James
Iâ€™m studying <a href="https://www.engineeringonline.ncsu.edu/programs-and-courses/certificates/computer-programming-certificate/courses/">computer science at NC State</a> ( Go Pack! :wolf: ) &nbsp; and learning full-stack web development via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. I primarily code in Java and JavaScript. 

I grew up in the 80s and 90s tinkering with computers and took my first programming classes in high school (Basic and Pascal). I built my first website on geocities and later learned to tweak WordPress themes. I'm enrolled in a course in C right now and learning how to use webpack and npm for building sites. My latest project is the restaurant-page.
