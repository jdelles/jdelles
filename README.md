## Hi, I'm James
Iâ€™m studying <a href="https://www.engineeringonline.ncsu.edu/programs-and-courses/certificates/computer-programming-certificate/courses/">computer science at NC State</a> ( Go Pack! :wolf: ) and learning full-stack web development via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. I primarily work in Java and JavaScript. 

I grew up playing any computer games I could get my hands on in the 80s and 90s. In high school, I took my first programming classes (Basic and Pascal). I launched my first website on geocities and later ran a few extremely successful WordPress blogs. My latest project is the <a href="https://jdelles.github.io/to-do-list/">To Do List</a>, which is a project written in JavaScript following specifications provided by The Odin Project.
