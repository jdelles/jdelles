## Hi, I'm James
Iâ€™m studying <a href="https://www.engineeringonline.ncsu.edu/programs-and-courses/certificates/computer-programming-certificate/courses/">computer science at NC State</a> ( Go Pack! :wolf: ) &nbsp; and learning full-stack web development via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. I code in Java and JavaScript. I am passionate about contributing to solutions to problems that impact climate change, education, personal finance and poverty. 

I grew up in the 80s and 90s tinkering with computers and took my first CS class in high school. I built my first website on geocities and later learned to tweak WordPress themes. I'm enrolled in a course in C right now and learning how to use webpack and npm for building sites. My latest project is the restaurant-page. 

School repos are private - projects there have included: 
- A single player "Mastermind" game built with a partner that included a GUI with randomized code generation and feedback during each round.  
- A university scheduling system utilizing OOP to manage students and faculty schedules, course information, enrollment data and IO functionality. 
- A report manager for a robot vacuum cleaner. The objective was to create efficient algorithms for parsing 2 types of raw data objects into 3 reports using a variety of data structures and then to test and analyze the runtime of various data structures.
