## Hi, I'm James
I'm a  <a href="https://www.engineeringonline.ncsu.edu/programs-and-courses/certificates/computer-programming-certificate/courses/">computer science</a> student at North Carolina State University. ( Go Pack! :wolf: ) Courses include: Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Development Fundamentals, Discrete Mathematics, C and Software Tools. School projects are primarily completed in Java. I expect to graduate in May 2022. Current GPA 3.733. 
  
I'm also learning full-stack web development via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. The Odin Project is a self-paced, free online coding bootcamp with two tracks: Ruby and JavaScript. I chose the JavaScript track and work on this between school semesters. I'm about half way through the program and looking forward to starting React over the next school break. You'll mainly find TOP projects in this repo. School projects are held privately for academic integrity reasons. 
  
Education, healthcare, and personal finance are my main interests. I'm actively looking for open source projects in those domains to stick my toe in.
